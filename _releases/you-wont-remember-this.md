description: >-
  Tuxis Giant's new album - out 8/15 - is rich in storytelling, sitting
  naturally alongside the more introspective corners of indie-folk and
  alt-Americana.


  Despite the self-effacing title, there’s both vulnerability and a quiet confidence to *You Won’t Remember This*. The record touches on themes of gender, growing into yourself, and family, all built into the album’s ark on human memory - how we remember, forget, and wish that we could forget.
